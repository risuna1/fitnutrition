## 📁 Service Files Structure

```
frontend/src/services/
├── api.js                    ✅ (Axios instance with JWT interceptors)
├── auth.js                   ✅ (Authentication & user management)
├── measurements.js           ✅ (Body measurements tracking)

└── recommendations.js        ✅ (AI-powered recommendations)
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### API Configuration
- **Base URL:** Configured via environment variable
- **Authentication:** JWT Bearer token in headers
- **Interceptors:** 
  - Request interceptor adds auth token
  - Response interceptor handles token refresh
  - Error interceptor handles 401 errors

### Service Pattern
Each service follows a consistent pattern:
```javascript
const service = {
  getAll: async (params) => { /* ... */ },
  getById: async (id) => { /* ... */ },
  create: async (data) => { /* ... */ },
  update: async (id, data) => { /* ... */ },
  delete: async (id) => { /* ... */ },
};
```

### Error Handling
- All services use try-catch in the calling components
- API errors are propagated to the UI layer
- Token refresh is handled automatically

## 📝 Notes

### Services Layer Benefits:
1. **Separation of Concerns:** API logic separated from UI
2. **Reusability:** Services can be used across multiple components
3. **Maintainability:** Easy to update API endpoints in one place
4. **Type Safety:** Can add TypeScript types later
5. **Testing:** Services can be mocked for component testing

### Integration Ready:
All services are ready to be integrated with React components. They provide:
- Consistent API interface
- Error handling structure
- Authentication management
- Request/response transformation
