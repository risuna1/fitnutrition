# Frontend Export Error Fix

## Issue
The frontend build was failing with the following error:
```
✘ [ERROR] No matching export in "src/services/auth.js" for import "default"

    src/pages/auth/Login.jsx:23:7:
      23 │ import authService from '../../services/auth';
         ╵        ~~~~~~~~~~~

✘ [ERROR] No matching export in "src/services/auth.js" for import "default"

    src/pages/auth/Register.jsx:24:7:
      24 │ import authService from '../../services/auth';
```

## Root Cause
The `auth.js` service file was exporting a named export (`export const authService = {...}`), but the Login and Register components were trying to import it as a default export (`import authService from '...'`).

## Solution
Added a default export to `frontend/src/services/auth.js`:

```javascript
export const authService = {
  // ... all methods
}

export default authService  // Added this line
```

## Result
✅ Frontend now builds and runs successfully on `http://localhost:5174/`
✅ No more import/export errors
✅ All service files now have consistent export patterns

## Verification
The fix was verified by running:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The server started successfully without any build errors.

## Related Files
- `frontend/src/services/auth.js` - Fixed
- `frontend/src/pages/auth/Login.jsx` - Uses default import
- `frontend/src/pages/auth/Register.jsx` - Uses default import

All other service files (`analytics.js`, `nutrition.js`, `workouts.js`, `recommendations.js`, `measurements.js`) already had proper default exports.
