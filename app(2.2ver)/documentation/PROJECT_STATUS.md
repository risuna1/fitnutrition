## 📝 Notes

### Current State
- Backend foundation is solid with Users and Measurements apps complete
- Database models are well-structured with proper relationships
- API endpoints follow RESTful conventions
- JWT authentication is configured and ready
- Admin panel is set up for all completed models

### Technical Decisions Made
- PostgreSQL for database (scalable, robust)
- JWT for authentication (stateless, secure)
- Groq API for AI features (fast, cost-effective)
- React + Vite for frontend (modern, fast)
- Tailwind CSS for styling (utility-first, responsive)

### Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Complex nutrition tracking
  - **Solution**: Separate Food and Meal models with many-to-many relationships

- **Challenge**: AI recommendations with limited context
  - **Solution**: Use Groq API with detailed user profile data

- **Challenge**: Real-time progress tracking
  - **Solution**: Efficient database queries with proper indexing

### Performance Considerations
- Database queries optimized with select_related and prefetch_related
- Pagination implemented for list views
- Image uploads optimized with Pillow
- API responses cached where appropriate
